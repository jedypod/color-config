# Truelight LUTs

[Filmlight](https://www.filmlight.ltd.uk/index.php) is the creator of [Baselight](https://www.filmlight.ltd.uk/products/baselight/overview_bl.php), an extremely high quality color grading software. Their color science is insane and beyond anything I've seen anywhere else. If you're interested in having your mind blown, check out their vimeo channel and watch through some of their training.

It turns out they also make a software called [Prelight](https://www.filmlight.ltd.uk/products/prelight/overview_pl.php), which is free to use. It includes a few of their [Truelight colorspaces](https://www.filmlight.ltd.uk/products/truelight/overview_tl.php). It doesn't support lut export, but you can import and export images.

Experimenting I figured out how to save out lut images with transformations applied and to create spi3d luts for the different color transforms. It's very interesting to compare the look of their display transforms to ACES. They are quite different and (in my opinion) a lot more cinematic.
