# OCIO Configs
Custom OpenColorIO configs created for fun and distributed for learning. These configs are experiments created because I'm too curious for my own good, and because I'm a giant nerd. They should probably not be used in production and are not intended to replace or critique the excellent work done to create the standard ACES OCIO Configs.
